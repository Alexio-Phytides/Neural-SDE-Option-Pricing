# No-Arbitrage Option Pricing with Neural SDEs
This repository contains all the code used to conduct numerical experiments in my dissertation paper being submitted for
the Degree of Master of Philosophy in Mathematical Finance at the University of the Cape Town.

We review three different training methodologies for training neural SDEs, and subsequently price options with these neural SDEs, while keeping consistent with the no-arbitrage option pricing requirements. We review the following training methodologies: 
1. Training the Diffusion Coefficient in Isolation,
2. Method of Moments Training, and
3. Training with Option Prices. 

We compare these training methodologies to options prices under the Black-Scholes and CEV models.
